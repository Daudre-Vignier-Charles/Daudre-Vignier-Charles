## About

Iâ€™m an IT Infrastructure Engineer, performing audits, administration, and engineering across various fields of IT infrastructure.

My personal servers run Unix-like systems (BSD, Linux, Solaris), and I use Debian as my desktop OS. I develop in C, C#, Lua, and Python 3 for both professional and personal needs. I also write shell scripts (I'm a Zsh enthusiast) and am a fan of Vim and Git.

I also like to create SVG icons with Inkscape and play with CAD softwares (I'm definitively not a good CAD engineer but it is fun and useful).

And if you're wondering about my hobbies:
- reading books,
- hiking and trekking,
- finance (I studied accounting and corporate finance), valuation of listed shares, fundamental analysis
- pharmacology (especially CNS pharmacology) and chemistry
- computer games: first-person shooters (FPS) like Call of Duty, Modern Warfare or Battlefield, real-time strategy (RTS) and turn-based strategy (TBS)
